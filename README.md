# MOVIE RECOMMENDER SYSTEM
Data Source: TMDB 5000 movies dataset from Kaggle.

## About the data:
There are two CSV files:

### 1) Credits_csv
contains 4 columns:

movie_id - unique id of the movie
title - name of the movie
cast - a list of dictionaries containing information about all the cast members of the movie
crew - a list of dictionaries containing information about all the crew members of the movie

### 2) movies_csv
contains 20 columns:

budget - The budget in which the movie was made
genre - The genre of the movie, Action, Comedy ,Thriller etc. A movie can belong to multiple genres.
homepage - The official web page of the movie
id - Unique identifier of the movie
keywords - list of keywords used to decribe the movie
original_language - The language in which the movie was shot
original_title - The title of the movie

production_companies - Companies involved in producing the movie
production_countries - Countries in which the movie was produced
release_date - Releasing date of the movie

spoken_languages - Languages in which the movie was released in
status - status of the movie : released / rumoured / Post production (all the movies in this data are released)
tagline - Tagline of the movie
title - same as original title, different if the name of the movie was changed later
vote_average - average rating of the movie by users
vote_count - count of votes the movie received by users

### Since this dataset only contains info about the movies and not users, collaborative filtering is excluded.

In this project I have worked on 3 types of recommender systems:
  1) Weighted rating based
  2) Content based (on overview)
  3) Content based (on metadata like director, actors, crew, etc)
