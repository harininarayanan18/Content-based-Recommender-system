Detection of Sleep Arousal. 

Various physiological signals such as EEG, EOG, EMG, ECG, etc can be collected during polysomnographic sleep studies and used to detect sources of arousal (non-apnea) during sleep.  Sleep is critical to health and well-being. Inadequate or poor-quality sleep is associated with a wide range of negative outcomes, such as impaired cognitive and motor function, irritability, obesity, and depression. “Arousals” are brief intrusions of wakefulness into sleep, after which sleep resumes and can cause harm when excessive.  

It follows that improving the quality of sleep could be used to improve a range of societal health outcomes, more generally. Of course, the treatment of sleep disorders is preceded by the diagnosis of sleep disorders. Traditionally, such diagnoses are developed in sleep laboratory settings, where PSG, audio, and videography of sleeping subject may be carefully inspected by sleep experts to identify potential sleep disorders. This can be very useful in providing patients with good sleep.
